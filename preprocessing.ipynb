      "What We Do:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the SEI Emerging Technology Center, we describe our work as “making the recently possible mission-practical.” We help our government customers stay at the leading edge of technology by identifying, demonstrating, extending, and applying emerging software technologies to solve real government problems. We currently work in the fields of human-machine interaction, applied artificial intelligence and machine learning, and advanced computing—areas that are changing and progressing rapidly. As we show our customers how new technologies can improve their mission capabilities through rapid prototyping and iterative development, we both rely on and shape academic and industrial research.\\r\\nAre you creative, curious, energetic, collaborative, technology-focused, and hard-working? Are you interested in making a difference by bringing innovation to government organizations and beyond? Apply to join our team.\\r\\n\\r\\nPosition Summary:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a senior research scientist focusing on machine learning, you will identify, shape, apply, conduct, and lead research that matches critical U.S. government needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nRequirements:\\r\\nBS in Computer Science or related discipline with ten (10) years of experience; OR MS in the same fields with eight (8) years of experience; OR PhD with five (5) years of experience.\\r\\nFlexible to travel to other SEI offices in Pittsburgh and Washington, DC, sponsor sites, conferences, and offsite meetings on occasion. Moderate (25\") travel outside of your home location.\\r\\nYou will be subject to a background investigation and must be eligible to obtain and maintain a Department of Defense security clearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuties:\\r\\nHands-on research: You’ll conduct and lead novel research in applied machine learning and artificial intelligence.\\r\\nSolution development: You’ll work with and lead interdisciplinary teams to turn research results into prototype operational capabilities for government customers and stakeholders.\\r\\nStrategy: You’ll work with Center leaders and colleagues to plan, develop, and carry out an overall research strategy, and to influence the national research agenda regarding future technology.\\r\\nCollaboration: You'll actively participate on teams of software developers, researchers, designers, and technical leads. You'll build relationships and collaborate with researchers, government customers, and other stakeholders to understand challenges, needs, possible solutions, and research directions.\\r\\nMentoring: You'll contribute to improving the overall technical capabilities of the Center by mentoring and teaching others, participating in design (software and otherwise) sessions, and sharing insights and wisdom across the SEI Emerging Technology Center team.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowledge, Skills, and Abilities:\\r\\nDeep technical knowledge: You have performed extensive research in applied machine learning and artificial intelligence. You have worked with tools, techniques, algorithms, software, and programming languages for deep learning, reinforcement learning, statistics, sensors and sensor fusion, planning, computer vision, or related areas.\\r\\nCommunication and Collaboration: You have strong written and verbal communication skills and can interact collaboratively and diplomatically with customers and colleagues. You grasp the big picture, direction, and goals of an effort while focusing great attention to detail. You can present complex ideas to people who may not have a deep understanding of the subject area.\\r\\nDedication: You can meet deadlines while multi-tasking–sometimes under pressure and with shifting priorities.\\r\\nCreativity and Innovation: You are creative and curious, and you are inspired by the prospect of collaborating with premier researchers and visionaries at Carnegie Mellon and other universities and organizations. You quickly learn new procedures, techniques, and approaches.
