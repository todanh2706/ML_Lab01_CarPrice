# How to run
1. Run preprocessing.ipynb to preprocess the raw data.
2. Run check_data.py to understand the correlation between the features.
3. Run draw_data.py to generate the correlation figures.
4. Run search_for_best_params.py to find the best alpha and l1 ratio for the models.
5. Finally run main.py to train the models.
